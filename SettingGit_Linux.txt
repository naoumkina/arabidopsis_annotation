1. Create the GitHub repository FIRST
This was one of the key insights you discovered.

You must create the repo on GitHub before trying to push from your machine:

Go to GitHub

Click New Repository

Name it (e.g., arabidopsis_annotation)

Leave it empty (no README, no .gitignore)

Create it

This gives you the remote URL you’ll push to.

2. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the correct permissions
This was the other critical insight.

You created a fine‑grained PAT with:

Repository access → your specific repo

Permissions:

Contents: Read and Write

(Optional) Metadata: Read

This is the minimum needed for pushing code.

You also learned that:

PATs authenticate over HTTPS, not SSH

Government networks block SSH but allow HTTPS

So PATs work even when SSH is blocked

This is why your final setup succeeded.

3. Store the PAT in your Git credentials file
You placed your PAT into:
```bash
~/.git-credentials
```
Using the correct format:

https://USERNAME:PAT@github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git

This was essential because Git matches credentials by URL, and including the full repo path ensured Git used the correct token.

4. Set Git to use the credential helper

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```
This tells Git to read from `~/.git-credentials` automatically.

5. Add, commit, and push
Once the PAT was stored correctly and the repo existed, everything worked:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push
```
And GitHub accepted the PAT over HTTPS.
