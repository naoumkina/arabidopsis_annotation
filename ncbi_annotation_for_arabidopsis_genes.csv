JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation.
